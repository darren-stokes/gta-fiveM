Some code that I use in relation to my FiveM/ESX server.

# Files:
## car_insert.sql:
SQL file generated by cars_sql.py. Empties vehicles and reinserts vehicles that I've added in or replaced.

## cars_sql.py:
Python script that parses "server.cfg" file for add-on and replacement vehicles. Vechicles should be under a section entitled "Add-on Cars" and have the following format:
#### Add-on: 
>start \<ingame spawn name/esx folder\> # \<Make\> \<Model\> \(\<year\>\)
#### Replace:
>start \<esx folder\> # \<Make\> \<Model\> \(\<year\>\) replaces \<ingame vehicle\>

The "#" is used as a delimiter in the parsing code for both add-ons and replacements, "replaces" is used as a delimiter for replacements and identifies them as such

## server.cfg:
My server.cfg for my FXserver. Yours may differ. Only part I care about right now is everything under "Add-On Cars", this is the only format that will work correctly with my cars_sql.py file.

## vehicle_list.txt:
Plaintext list of the real world vehicles available in the SQL file 

## esx_drugs_sv.lua:
Replacement for https://github.com/loko06320/fxserver-esx_drugs/blob/master/server/esx_drugs_sv.lua as there is a newer way that ESX queries limits. Hard coded the limits into the file to bypass. Might look into moving the limits to the config.lua to make it a bit cleaner
